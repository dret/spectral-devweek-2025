# Spectral Workshop at DeveloperWeek 2025

These are the examples for the "API Linting with Spectral" workshop held at the [DeveloperWeek](https://www.developerweek.com/conference/) 2025 conference in Santa Clara.

In order for this to work as demonstrated you need to copy (or move) `pre-commit` to the `.git/hooks/` directory of your clone or fork.

The presentation slides [are available online at `dret.net/lectures/developerweek-2025/openapi-workshop-linting`](http://dret.net/lectures/developerweek-2025/openapi-workshop-linting).
